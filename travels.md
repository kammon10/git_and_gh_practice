My favorite destination was a trip I took to Turkey to visit my younger sister. We traveled deep into the mountains to small towns and ate at a beautiful restaurant surrounded by groves of olive trees. Next we traveled to a beach town on the coast of the black sea and went paragliding off the top of a mountain, flying between mountain peaks until we flew over the sea and landed on the beach.
