I was a Marine Corps corrections officer for almost 6 years before I left the military. Although I loved the Marine Corps, being a corrections officer was one of the most unrewarding occupations I've ever experienced. I was injured on duty and couldn't keep up with the physical demands the Marine Corps requires so I made the choice to leave after my contract was up. I needed a new career path and over a few years of exploring my options, I was introduced to coding and found that I love so much of what it has to offer. I love the problem solving, the room for creativity, the practical application and potential value in everyday life,  All of these matched my goals for a career.
